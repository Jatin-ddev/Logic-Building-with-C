main()
{

int i,j;

for(i=1;i<=5;i++)
 for(j=i+1;j<=4;j++)
  printf("%d",2*j-1);
getch();

}

// So Here We Have To DRY RUN , it means to manually trace the values!

/*

i,j are vaiables 

 

i is initialized to 1 , so i is one now , and then 2 consition is checked is i<=5 means is 1 <= 5 yea its true 
so it goes inside the loop j (is another variable) is initialized i+1 , and we know i is one so j becomes 1+1 that is 2 
now , 2<=4 yea its true so condition is true so , goes inside the loop 
so i = 1 , j = 2 , 2*j-1 becomes 2*2-1 = 3

so 

3 will get printed! and then next j++ will run so j is now 3 , is 3<=4 yea its true so goes inside loop print 2*j-1 that is 2*3-1 = 5 
5 will get prined now! and on similar basis it will runfurther 

TRY TO DO IT IN COPY , YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IT BETTER!
